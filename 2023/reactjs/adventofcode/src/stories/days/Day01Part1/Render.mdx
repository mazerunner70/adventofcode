# Render

The Render component renders each of the different states of the search experience for Advent of Code Day 1 Part 1.
The different states are defined in the [Render.stories.tsx](./Render.stories.tsx) file.
The algorithm is as follows:
1) If the search is not started, render the starting search state.
2) If the search is started, render the searching for left digit state.
3) If the search is started and the left digit is found, render the searching for right digit state.
4) If the search is started and the right digit is found, render the found state.

## Starting Search
Here the component flashes the line about to be searched and highlights the left character. That highlight is red if the left character is not found and blue if it is found.

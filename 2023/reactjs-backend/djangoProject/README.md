# Advent of Code GraphQL server
 

This document outlines the technical design for setting up a Django project with GraphQL integration. It covers the initial setup, database design, GraphQL integration, authentication, performance optimization, testing, deployment, and monitoring.

## 1. Project Setup

### Environment Setup
- Use `virtualenv` or `pipenv` for creating and managing a virtual environment.

### Install Django
- Run `pip install django` to install Django.

### Create Django Project
- Initialize the project with `django-admin startproject djangoProject`.

### Install GraphQL Libraries
- Install Graphene-Django using `pip install graphene-django`.
- Add `graphene_django` to `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`.
- Add `GRAPHENE` configuration to `settings.py`.
- Create a Django App for Advent of Code:
- Run `python manage.py startapp adventofcode`.
- 

## 2. Database Design

### Define Models
- Create models in `models.py` according to your data structure.

### Database Migrations
- Use Django's built-in migration system (`makemigrations` and `migrate`).

### Admin Interface
- Optionally, register models in `admin.py` for admin panel access.

## 3. Integrating GraphQL

### Schema Definition
- Define your GraphQL schema in a `schema.py` file using Graphene-Django.

#### Types
- Mirror your Django models in GraphQL types.

#### Queries
- Implement queries for data retrieval.

#### Mutations
- Create mutations for CRUD operations.

### GraphQL View
- Setup a GraphQL endpoint in `urls.py` using `GraphQLView` from Graphene-Django.

## 4. Authentication and Authorization

### Django's Authentication System
- Utilize Djangoâ€™s authentication for managing users.

### GraphQL Authentication
- Implement token authentication for GraphQL queries and mutations.

### Permissions
- Define permissions to restrict query and mutation access based on user roles.

## 5. Performance Optimization

### Query Optimization
- Optimize database queries using `select_related` and `prefetch_related`.

### Batching and Caching
- Implement DataLoader for batching and caching to improve performance.

## 6. Testing and Documentation

### Unit Tests
- Write tests for models, queries, and mutations.

### Integration Tests
- Ensure all parts of the application work together as expected.

### Documentation
- Document your API using GraphiQL or custom documentation tools.

## 7. Deployment

### Deployment Options
- Choose a suitable platform (Heroku, AWS, GCP).

### Static Files
- Configure handling of static files for production.

### Secure Deployment
- Ensure SSL/TLS setup and database security.

## 8. Monitoring and Logging

### Monitoring Tools
- Integrate tools like Sentry or New Relic for performance and error tracking.

### Logging
- Set up logging for effective debugging and monitoring.

This outline serves as a foundation for developing a Django project with GraphQL. It's crucial to adapt and expand upon this skeleton based on the specific requirements and challenges of your project.

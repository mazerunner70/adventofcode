This will help avoid issues related to service identity folder permissions and long file path restrictions on Windows.\n\nThe following snipped needs to be run on `powershell`:\n``` powershell\n# Create a folder under the drive root\nmkdir \\actions-runner ; cd \\actions-runner\n# Download the latest runner package\nInvoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.284.0/actions-runner-win-x64-2.284.0.zip -OutFile actions-runner-win-x64-2.284.0.zip\n# Extract the installer\nAdd-Type -AssemblyName System.IO.Compression.FileSystem ;\n[System.IO.Compression.ZipFile]::ExtractToDirectory(\"$PWD\\actions-runner-win-x64-2.284.0.zip\", \"$PWD\")\n```\n\n## OSX\n\n``` bash\n# Create a folder\nmkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner\n# Download the latest runner package\ncurl -O -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.284.0/actions-runner-osx-x64-2.284.0.tar.gz\n# Extract the installer\ntar xzf ./actions-runner-osx-x64-2.284.0.tar.gz\n```\n\n## Linux x64\n\n``` bash\n# Create a folder\nmkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner\n# Download the latest runner package\ncurl -O -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.284.0/actions-runner-linux-x64-2.284.0.tar.gz\n# Extract the installer\ntar xzf ./actions-runner-linux-x64-2.284.0.tar.gz\n```\n\n## Linux arm64\n\n``` bash\n# Create a folder\nmkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner\n# Download the latest runner package\ncurl -O -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.284.0/actions-runner-linux-arm64-2.284.0.tar.gz\n# Extract the installer\ntar xzf ./actions-runner-linux-arm64-2.284.0.tar.gz\n```\n\n## Linux arm\n\n``` bash\n# Create a folder\nmkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner\n# Download the latest runner package\ncurl -O -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.284.0/actions-runner-linux-arm-2.284.0.tar.gz\n# Extract the installer\ntar xzf ./actions-runner-linux-arm-2.284.0.tar.gz\n```\n\n## Using your self hosted runner\nFor additional details about configuring, running, or shutting down the runner please check out our [product docs.](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/adding-self-hosted-runners)\n\n## SHA-256 Checksums\n\nThe SHA-256 checksums for the packages included in this build are shown below:\n\n- actions-runner-win-x64-2.284.0.zip <!-- BEGIN SHA win-x64 -->7785341894d93b040aaef6656786f44b8fc52d8042f267705bf287939ce58f71<!-- END SHA win-x64 -->\n- actions-runner-osx-x64-2.284.0.tar.gz <!-- BEGIN SHA osx-x64 -->5f9dc650058151ddec7308d1fde89ab926af9dfcb5cf8137e6fe520baee8dbd3<!-- END SHA osx-x64 -->\n- actions-runner-linux-x64-2.284.0.tar.gz <!-- BEGIN SHA linux-x64 -->1ddfd7bbd3f2b8f5684a7d88d6ecb6de3cb2281a2a359543a018cc6e177067fc<!-- END SHA linux-x64 -->\n- actions-runner-linux-arm64-2.284.0.tar.gz <!-- BEGIN SHA linux-arm64 -->a7a4e31d93d5852710dbacbb5f024be581c337c1be92ba2c729bb81e756bd49b<!-- END SHA linux-arm64 -->\n- actions-runner-linux-arm-2.284.0.tar.gz <!-- BEGIN SHA linux-arm -->2891eefcd2cd0cea33aef2261b628017d0879f69d66481c18350e2e50f3933f3<!-- END SHA linux-arm -->",
